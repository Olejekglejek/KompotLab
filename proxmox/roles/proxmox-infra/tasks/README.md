To manage persistent storage in Talos Linux, especially for Kubernetes workloads, you typically use Kubernetes Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs). Here’s how you can use a USB stick for persistent storage in your setup:

1. Mount USB on Proxmox Host:
Format the USB stick (e.g., ext4 or xfs).
Mount it on your Proxmox host.
Pass the USB device through to your Talos VM (using Proxmox’s USB passthrough).

2. Expose USB Storage to Talos VM:
In Proxmox, add the USB device to the VM configuration.
Ensure Talos detects the device (check with talosctl or via the Talos API).

3. Configure Talos Machine Configuration:
Update your Talos machine config to mount the USB device as a local disk.
Example snippet for machine.disks in Talos config:

```
machine:
  disks:
    - device: /dev/sdX  # Replace with your USB device path
      partitions:
        - mountpoint: /var/mnt/usb
```
4. Create Kubernetes Persistent Volumes:

Use a hostPath PV if you want to expose the USB mount directly:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: usb-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /var/mnt/usb
```
5. Use PVCs in Your Workloads:
Reference the PVC in your pod specs to use the USB storage.

# Note:

Talos does not support SSH or direct shell access, so all configuration is done via the API or talosctl.
For production, consider using a proper CSI driver for more advanced storage management.
If you want step-by-step instructions for your exact setup (Proxmox + Talos), let me know your USB device path and how you want to use the storage!
